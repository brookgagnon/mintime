# minTime
minTime is a minimal time tracking web application. It also tracks billable amounts, whether tasks are invoiced, and currency exchanges for projects billed in other currencies.

minTime does not have a user/authentication system so access should be restricted somehow (HTTP authentication, etc).

# Requirements
PHP 5.6+, MySQL or MariaDB.

# Install
1. Create database and import mintime.sql.
2. Update config.php with database settings.
